# Min-AT-Samples-for-Robust-Image-Classifier
This repository contains the source code of the paper "Minimizing Adversarial Training Samples for Robust Image Classifiers: Analysis and adversarial example Generator Design". 

## Contents

The repository consists of the following:
  - `adversarial_train.py`: Code for adversarial training in the method.
  - `test_acc.py`: Code for measuring prediction accuracy.
  - `generate_and_test_new.py`: Code for adversarial attack.
  - 'new_gan/model/wgan_C_gan.py': Code for new GAN network.
  - 'new_gan/train_gan.py': Code for training new GAN.

## Usage

To use our method, follow the instructions below:

1. Navigate to the `Min-AT-Samples-for-Robust-Image-Classifier/` directory.
2. Run `adversarial_train.py` to implement adversarial training.
3. Use `test_acc.py` to perform predictions using the proposed method.
4. Use 'new_gan/train_gan.py' to implement GAN training.
